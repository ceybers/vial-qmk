# VOID Ergo S

VIAL configuration for [Victor Lucachi](https://github.com/victorlucachi/qmk_firmware/tree/dev_void/keyboards/handwired/void_ergo)'s Void Ergo keyboard.

 - VIAL unlock is the top left key on the left hand side and the top right key on the right hand side.
 - Rotary encoders disabled because I am not using them on my build.
 - `config.h` fixed from 8x12 to 8Ã—6 in order to work with VIA/VIAL. 
 - Compiled `.hex` is available in the root directory for convenience.
